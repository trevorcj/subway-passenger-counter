# Subway Passenger Counter App

This project is one of the projects in the Scrimba JavaScript course by Per Borgen.

This web application was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I refactored the code by using the addEventListener method on the increment and save buttons.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trevorcj/subway-passenger-counter.git
   ```
2. Click `index.html` to open it in your browser.

Happy Coding! 👩🏾‍💻
